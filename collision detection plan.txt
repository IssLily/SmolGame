collision detection (against tilemap):

we take the current x and y coordinate. We can divide both by 8 to give
a tile we're "currently" in.

If X mod 8 is not 0, we are also partially in the tile to the right
If y mod 8 is not 0, we are also partially in the tile to the bottom

if the Y coord mod 8 is >3 then we snap to the top by adding 1 and 
multiplying by 8

if the Y coord mod 8 is < 4 then we snap to the bottom by not adding 1
and multiplying by 8

if the x coord mod 8 is > 3 then we snap to the left by not adding 1 and
multiplying by 8.

If the x coord mod 8 is <4 then we snap to the right by adding 1 and
multiplying by 8.

This is all provided the appropriate tiles are solid.
