technical things to do:

- animation for sprites (capability + PC animations)
- do the boundary checking on the screen
- implement changing screens
- figure out a good method for both sound effects and music
- figure out a small way to do cutscenes (scripting?)
- implement items/inventory
- implement pausing and the pause screen.
- implement the player attack (punch as default)
- implement an enemy handler (sprite drawing plus behaviour)

non-technical things to do:
- player character artwork
- figure out an idea of the narrative + lore - good start made
- work on the world-map and how stuff fits together
- work out some exciting set pieces that are achievable within hardware constraints.


all of these things are in no particular order.

BBC Master bonuses:
 - make movement smoother with extra versions of sprites.
